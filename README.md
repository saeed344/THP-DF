1. The datasets file contains Small and Main90.
2. APAAC, AAC, AA-AINDEX, EAAC, and PAAC implement Feature extraction.
3. BiLSTM and attention are the implementations of deep fusion.
4. SVM, RF, Adaboost, RF, KNN, LR, and XGBoost implement the classifier.

Configuration Environment：python=3.7, tensorflow=2.2.0, keras=2.4.3, numpy=1.19.5

Note: The input file location in the program needs to be matched with the personal file location！
